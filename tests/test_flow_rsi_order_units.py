"""
Regression guard for the FlowRsiBot SL/TP unit bug (2026-09-22 demo incident).

cTrader's ``ExecuteMarketOrder(tradeType, symbol, volume, label, stopLossPips,
takeProfitPips, comment)`` takes DISTANCES IN PIPS. FlowRsiBot used to hand it the
absolute ``slPrice`` / ``tpPrice`` levels, so the broker received e.g.
"SL: 1.1 pips" on EURUSD (stopped out by spread noise within seconds, +-$0.xx) and
"SL: 4332 pips" on XAUUSD (= $43 risk instead of the intended $9).

The Python suite has no .NET toolchain, so these tests pin the source-level
contract of the order call in ``ExecuteTechnicalOrder``.
